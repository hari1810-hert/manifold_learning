This project explores manifold learning techniques for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Using algorithms such as PCA, Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and t-SNE, the notebook demonstrates how high-dimensional data can be projected onto low-dimensional manifolds while preserving intrinsic geometric structure. The workflow includes loading datasets, preprocessing, applying manifold learning methods, visualizing embeddings, and comparing their effectiveness. These techniques reveal patterns, clusters, and meaningful relationships that are not visible in the original space. The project provides an educational, hands-on introduction to nonlinear dimensionality reduction for data exploration and visualization.
